Welcome to MatLib for Maya documentation
========================================

MatLib is a free tool that stores materials for reuse.

**Why use MatLib?**

Currently there are no easy solutions to reuse materials.
Oftentimes well-designed, unique materials are forgotten or lost in their respective folders. Worse yet, even if you can find these materials, the related textures might have been deleted from the computer.
Without having to deal with manual work, MatLib organizes the materials that you created and brings them to your scene in a few steps. It also stores the textures in relevant folders automatically.

This guide provides information on setting up and using MatLib for Maya.
