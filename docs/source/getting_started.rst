Renderer
____

Renderer lists all the render engines that MatLib can run, loaded on your DCC application.

If you have more than one renderer that supported by MatLib, switching between them will change

Repository Selection
____

This is the area where you will choose which repository MatLib will run on.

The repository is the area where the files and folders required for MatLib are stored. The selected repository calls and displays the registered categories and materials belonging to these categories.

When MatLib runs, if it is used for the first time or if the repository you used before has been deleted, it will allow you to select a folder to create a new repository named as  'Default Repository' and automatically links the repository path to MatLib.

When you link a new repository, it is added to this menu with the given name.

When a repository other than Default Repository is selected, it will appear in a slightly reddish color as a reminder.


Categories
____

Categories are areas where materials are stored. For example, materials such as chrome, copper and aluminum fall into the category of metals.
To create a category, you must give the category a name (such as metals) on the dialog screen that opens after pressing the '+' button under the category section.
Pressing the accept button will immediately add the new category to the Categories menu.

To delete a category, you need to type 'YES' in capital letters in the dialog box that opens after pressing the '-' button.

Since some repositories are protected with a password, the password screen will appear after pressing the '-' button. If the correct password is entered, a dialog will pop up asking if you are sure, same as unencrypted repositories.

.. warning::
   Deleted repositories do not have backup files, so the deletion cannot be undone.
